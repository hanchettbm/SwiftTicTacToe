# Overview
The software that I wrote runs through a simple Tic Tac Toe game, that allows 2 users to play, for X and O, and stores their moves in a dictoionary to be displayed, it checks for valid moves, wins, and ties. This is all done using swift on the command line.   

**Purpose:**  
My purose for writing this software was to learn the swift programming language in preparation to make an iPhone app. I used a simple game with code and comand line logic I already understood, so that I could spend more time learning and understanding the syntax and working of the language. Plus it is a useful and fun way to demonstrate what I have learned.
